Hiiiii!

I'm **River**, or my online alias, **Prae**! I'm a 17-year-old developer that only works in Java (for now) planning to head into Computer Science! I'm also currently doing Minecraft modding and plugin development as a hobby and to learn as I go!

My ideas are a bit... "[unique](https://github.com/Praenyth/JumpLeak)" but programming becomes interesting if I can introduce my own silly little quirks into whatever I get my hands on.

I have done quite a bit of projects that I hope to have the time to continue:

- [SomethingRising](https://github.com/SillySaucersIncorporated/SomethingRising) - A little plugin I've developed for [Curesd](https://www.youtube.com/@Curesd_) that allows for any block to rise up from the depths and force players into weird battles!
- [Pradon](https://github.com/Praenyth/Pradon) - A remake of an older plugin that allows for players to get a large amount of a random item from a list of items and battle it out until one player remains!
- [HallowsEve](https://github.com/Praenyth/HallowsEve) - Another little mod I've developed for the HallowsEve SMP which introduces Souls that drop from players and give some great buffs with every 5 souls.
- [Prag](https://github.com/Praenyth/Prag) - An unfinished tag plugin I've worked on, with a wide range of settings and modes to keep the minigame replayable!
- [Kamikaze](https://github.com/Praenyth/kamikaze) - Another little plugin I've developed for [Curesd](https://www.youtube.com/@Curesd_) that punishes players for killing others, by turning them into fireworks and exploding! :3
- [Minecart Crashes](https://github.com/Praenyth/minecart-crashes-fabric) - The first ever mod I've publicly released properly, allowing for players to run over other players using minecarts and enough speed from powered rails. The mod also increases the speed of minecarts to allow for them to have actual use in the speed department, as regular minecarts aren't often used.

...and hopefully more to come! :3
